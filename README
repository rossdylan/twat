twat
Watch hashtaged tweets across the earth in real time

What works:
	the twitter stuff works, the twitter data streaming part of the project works fine
	It finds tweets with geolocation data, and hashtags. Unfortunately my account only has access to the spritzer so
	Not many of the tweets that come down the pipe have all the nessicary data.

Todo:
	1) Move away from eventlet
		The version of eventlet in pypi has a very outdated websocket server implementation
		I am currently using a patched version which i patched again myself to make work with chrome 19
	2) Serve ws.html and ws.js 
		Right now these are just browsed to on my local machine
	3) Actually plot points on a map
		spent most of my time thus far making those stupid websockets work
